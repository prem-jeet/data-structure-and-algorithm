# Problem statement :

        Given a matrix containing 0's and 1's,
        from all the connected components in the matrix
        find the one having maximum size

# Example :

        ### INPUT :

                1100
                0100
                0000
                0110

        ###OUTPUT :

                3

# Explaination :

        Connected components are denoted by 1's
        In the above graph we have Two connected components,
        One of length 3, and another of length 2,
        The program returns the maximum
